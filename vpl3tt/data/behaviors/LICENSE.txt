The program files are an adaptation. The program source code has been
extracted from .aesl files (xml) and saved as .aseba files (plain text).
Constant declarations have been moved to source code with undocumented
"const" statements, event declarations have been discarded, and "emit"
statements (which require event declarations but are useful only in
Studio) have been commented out.
