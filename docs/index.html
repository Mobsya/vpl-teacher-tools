<p>* Database format change. Please delete file vplserver-db.sqlite in your home directory manually. You will loose all its content, including the pupil names and the files. To preserve the pupil names, you can export them with your current version of the VPL Teacher Tools, delete vplserver-db.sqlite and upgrade the VPL Teacher Tools, and import the pupil names in the new version. Likewise for the teacher files, you can export them with the current version and reimport them with the new version.</p>
